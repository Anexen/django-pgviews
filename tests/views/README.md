This is a high-level test of the interaction between views and migrations in
the development and deployment of a Django project. The database
`postgresql://localhost/django_postgres_viewtest` needs to exist for this test
to work.

To run it, just do:

    $ ./do_viewtest.sh
    $ ./cleanup_viewtest.sh
